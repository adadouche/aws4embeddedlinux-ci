TODO: Fill this README out!


### dev tricks
```bash
meta-aws-ci/demos-pipeline$ npm link ../../aws4embeddedlinux-ci/
```
If you asked to get sudo permissions you need to setup a user npm folder - Ubuntu needs this before:

```bash
cat  ~/.npmrc 
prefix=/home/XXX/.npm-packages
```

Be sure to:

* Change the title in this README
